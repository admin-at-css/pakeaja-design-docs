## Common Questions

### Q: What if I've never designed B2B SaaS before?

**A:** Be honest in your application.

If this is your first B2B SaaS project:
- Acknowledge learning curve
- Add 20-30% buffer to timeline estimate
- Propose starting with Project 1 only (15 screens, lower risk)
- Highlight transferable skills (e.g., complex e-commerce dashboards, admin panels)

**We value honesty.** Junior designers welcome if portfolio shows strong fundamentals.

---

### Q: Can I use existing UI kits (Material Design, Ant Design, Tailwind UI)?

**A:** Partially, but not fully.

- ‚úÖ Use as inspiration for component patterns
- ‚úÖ Adapt components to match PakeAja brand
- ‚ùå Don't just reskin existing UI kit (we need custom design system)

We want a **custom design system**, not a generic template.

---

### Q: How much creative freedom do I have?

**A:** A lot! You decide:
- Color palette (no brand guidelines exist yet)
- Typography (choose fonts that fit professional B2B aesthetic)
- Component style (rounded vs sharp, shadows vs flat)
- Layout patterns (as long as functional requirements met)

**Rule:** As long as it's professional, efficient, and meets functional requirements ‚Üí full creative freedom.

See **[DESIGN_BRIEF.md](DESIGN_BRIEF.md)** for aesthetic references we like.

### Q: What file formats do you need?

**A:** Figma only.

**Deliverables format:**
- Low-fidelity wireframes: Figma frames
- High-fidelity mockups: Figma frames (production-ready)

- Interactive prototypes: Figma prototype mode (clickable, presentation-ready)

**After design approval, you'll also provide:**
- Design tokens export (JSON or similar)
- Style guide documentation (PDF or Notion doc)
- Developer handoff notes (edge cases, interactions)

---

### Q: Will I work directly with the founder or a team?

**A:** Directly with Kevin (founder).

**Working style:**
- Weekly Google Meet check-ins (30-60 minutes)
- Async communication via email (respond within 24 hours)
- Milestone-based deliveries (review at end of each phase)
- Figma collaboration (Kevin will comment directly in Figma)

**No bureaucracy.** Fast decisions, direct feedback.

---

### Q: What if PakeAja pivots or changes scope?

**A:** Unlikely (problem validated, market research done).

But if scope changes significantly:
- We'll discuss compensation adjustments
- You can exit gracefully (payment for completed work)
- Or continue with revised scope

**Payment protection:** Milestone-based (30%-30%-30%-10%), you're paid as you deliver.
