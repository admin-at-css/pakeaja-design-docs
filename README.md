## Application Workflow

### Step 1: Review Documentation (2-3 hours)

**DO NOT skip this step.** Accurate proposals require understanding full scope.

**Recommended reading order:**
1. PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md (understand the business)
2. PRD.md (understand product requirements)
3. USER_PERSONAS.md (understand your users)
4. INFORMATION_ARCHITECTURE.md (understand navigation)
5. USER_FLOWS.md (understand workflows)
6. DESIGN_BRIEF.md (understand design expectations)
7. SCOPE.md (understand deliverables)
8. DESIGN_COMPLEXITY.md (understand complexity)
9. HOW_TO_PROPOSE.md (calculate budget)

**After reading, you should know:**
- ✅ What problem PakeAja solves (WhatsApp → professional platform)
- ✅ Who the users are (contractors, project owners, their pain points)
- ✅ What screens need to be designed (23 screens: 15 contractor + 8 client)
- ✅ What deliverables are expected (wireframes, mockups, design system, prototypes)
- ✅ Why this is complex (2-sided platform, data-heavy dashboards, design system from scratch)
- ✅ How to calculate budget (effort breakdown by deliverable)

---

### Step 2: Calculate Budget & Timeline (1-2 hours)

Use the framework in **[HOW_TO_PROPOSE.md](HOW_TO_PROPOSE.md)** to calculate:

**Effort Estimation:**
- Wireframes (23 screens): 17-23 hours
- High-fidelity mockups (23 screens): 65-80 hours
- Design system (40-50 components): 40-58 hours
- Interactive prototypes (8-10 flows): 15-20 hours
- Revisions & refinements (25% buffer): 34-45 hours
- **Total: 171-226 hours**

**Budget Calculation:**
- Determine your hourly rate (based on experience, skills)
- Multiply by estimated hours
- Compare to indicative budget (Rp 9 juta)
- Decide: Accept budget / Negotiate / Propose partial delivery

**Timeline Projection:**
- Full-time (40 hrs/week): 6-7 weeks
- Part-time (20 hrs/week): 10-12 weeks
- Freelance (15 hrs/week): 12-15 weeks

---

### Step 3: Submit Application (15-20 minutes)

**Application Form:** [GOOGLE FORM LINK PROVIDED IN JOB POSTING]

**What to prepare:**
- ✅ Portfolio link (Behance, Dribbble, personal website, Google Drive)
- ✅ Brief introduction & UI/UX experience (years, specializations)
- ✅ Budget proposal (breakdown by deliverable, hourly rate, total)
- ✅ Timeline estimate (start date, weekly availability, completion date)
- ✅ Design approach (how would you approach design system creation?)
- ✅ Case study (1 project you're most proud of, explain your process)

**Pro Tips:**
- Be honest about experience level (honesty > overpromising)
- Justify budget if significantly different from indicative (explain why)
- Mention if you've designed B2B SaaS or dashboards before
- Express interest in long-term collaboration (not just one-off project)

- Project-specific questions (how would you design for non-tech-savvy Indonesian contractors?)
- Budget & timeline confirmation (negotiate if needed)
- Long-term collaboration interest (Phase 2 features, marketing materials, retainer)

## Long-Term Collaboration Opportunity

**This is NOT a one-off project.**

We're looking for a **design partner** for PakeAja's long-term journey. If you deliver excellent results on MVP:

### Future Opportunities:
- **Phase 2 Features:** CRM, Inventory, Supplier Portal, Mobile App (Rp 15-20 juta)

**Think of MVP as an audition** for long-term partnership. See **[FUTURE_PHASES.md](FUTURE_PHASES.md)** for details.

---

## Budget Transparency

### Why Rp 9 juta for 23 screens?

**Our Calculation:**
- Estimated hours: 160-180 hours (experienced designer, efficient workflow)
- Target rate: Rp 50,000-60,000/hour (mid-level Indonesian designer)
- Total: 170 hours × Rp 53,000/hour ≈ **Rp 9,000,000**

**This assumes:**
- Designer has B2B SaaS experience (no learning curve)
- Designer has created design systems before (reusable templates)
- Designer works efficiently (not first complex project)
- Minimal revision rounds (clear requirements provided)

**If your estimate is different:**
- ✅ **Higher (Rp 11-15 juta):** Justify in proposal (senior rate, extra hours for complexity)
- ✅ **Accept Rp 9 juta:** Position for long-term partnership (competitive Phase 1 → stable income Phase 2+)
- ✅ **Propose partial delivery:** "I can do Project 1 for Rp 6 juta, then reassess for Project 2"

**We value honesty > underbidding.** Realistic estimates preferred over overpromising.

---

## Common Questions

### Q: What if I've never designed B2B SaaS before?

**A:** Be honest in your application.

If this is your first B2B SaaS project:
- Acknowledge learning curve
- Add 20-30% buffer to timeline estimate
- Propose starting with Project 1 only (15 screens, lower risk)
- Highlight transferable skills (e.g., complex e-commerce dashboards, admin panels)

**We value honesty.** Junior designers welcome if portfolio shows strong fundamentals.

---

### Q: Can I use existing UI kits (Material Design, Ant Design, Tailwind UI)?

**A:** Partially, but not fully.

- ✅ Use as inspiration for component patterns
- ✅ Adapt components to match PakeAja brand
- ❌ Don't just reskin existing UI kit (we need custom design system)

We want a **custom design system**, not a generic template.

---

### Q: How much creative freedom do I have?

**A:** A lot! You decide:
- Color palette (no brand guidelines exist yet)
- Typography (choose fonts that fit professional B2B aesthetic)
- Component style (rounded vs sharp, shadows vs flat)
- Layout patterns (as long as functional requirements met)

**Rule:** As long as it's professional, efficient, and meets functional requirements → full creative freedom.

See **[DESIGN_BRIEF.md](DESIGN_BRIEF.md)** for aesthetic references we like.

---

### Q: What file formats do you need?

**A:** Figma only.

**Deliverables format:**
- Low-fidelity wireframes: Figma frames
- High-fidelity mockups: Figma frames (production-ready)
- Design system: Figma component library (organized, with variants, auto-layout)
- Interactive prototypes: Figma prototype mode (clickable, presentation-ready)

**After design approval, you'll also provide:**
- Design tokens export (JSON or similar)
- Style guide documentation (PDF or Notion doc)
- Developer handoff notes (edge cases, interactions)

---

### Q: Will I work directly with the founder or a team?

**A:** Directly with Kevin (founder).

**Working style:**
- Weekly Google Meet check-ins (30-60 minutes)
- Async communication via email (respond within 24 hours)
- Milestone-based deliveries (review at end of each phase)
- Figma collaboration (Kevin will comment directly in Figma)

**No bureaucracy.** Fast decisions, direct feedback.

---

### Q: What if PakeAja pivots or changes scope?

**A:** Unlikely (problem validated, market research done).

But if scope changes significantly:
- We'll discuss compensation adjustments
- You can exit gracefully (payment for completed work)
- Or continue with revised scope

**Payment protection:** Milestone-based (30%-30%-30%-10%), you're paid as you deliver.

---

## Designer Qualifications We're Looking For

### Must-Have:
- ✅ Expert-level Figma (auto-layout, variants, components, prototypes)
- ✅ Portfolio with 3+ projects (case studies showing process)
- ✅ Understanding of Indonesian UI/UX conventions
- ✅ Good communication skills (Bahasa Indonesia)
- ✅ Full commitment for project duration (6-8 weeks availability)

### Nice-to-Have:
- 🌟 B2B SaaS or dashboard design experience
- 🌟 Complete design system creation from scratch
- 🌟 Mobile-first responsive design expertise
- 🌟 Developer handoff best practices (worked with dev teams before)
