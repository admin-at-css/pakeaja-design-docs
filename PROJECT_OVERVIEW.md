# PakeAja - Project Overview

## The Problem We're Solving

### Current State: WhatsApp-Based Project Management

Indonesian painting contractors (especially SMEs) currently manage multi-million rupiah projects using **WhatsApp groups**:

**Pain Points:**
- üì± **Progress photos scattered** across WA chats (hard to find, no organization)
- üí∞ **Budget tracking in Excel** (manual, error-prone, not real-time)
- üìÑ **Invoices sent as PDF via WA** (no tracking, lost messages, unprofessional)
- üìÖ **Timeline updates verbal** (no accountability, client confusion)
- üë• **No transparency** for clients (have to ask PM: "Gimana progress-nya?")
- üîç **No audit trail** (can't prove what was communicated when)

**Result:**
- Clients feel uninformed and anxious (constantly asking for updates)
- Contractors spend hours answering repetitive questions
- Disputes arise ("I never said that!", "Where's the photo from last week?")
- Unprofessional image (hard to win larger contracts)

## Why We Need a Great Designer

**PakeAja's success depends on UX.**

Contractors won't adopt complex software (they'll stick with WhatsApp). Clients won't use portals that are confusing (they'll keep calling PMs).

**Your design must:**
- ‚úÖ Make contractors **more productive** (save time, not add work)
- ‚úÖ Make clients **feel informed** (reduce anxiety, build trust)
- ‚úÖ Be **approachable** for non-tech users (Indonesian SME contractors)
- ‚úÖ Look **professional** (contractors show to clients to win contracts)
- ‚úÖ Scale **efficiently** (design system supports rapid feature development)

**The right design = product success.**
**The wrong design = users abandon platform.**

This is why we're investing time and budget to find the **right design partner**.

## What Happens After Design is Complete?

### Development Timeline (Estimated):
- **Month 1-3:** Frontend development (React/Next.js)
- **Month 4-5:** Backend development (Supabase, API integrations)
- **Month 6:** Testing, bug fixes, deployment
- **Month 7:** Beta launch (10-20 customers)

## Questions You Might Have

### Q: Is there existing branding or design?
**A:** Minimal. Landing page exists (proof of concept, no branding). **You have full creative freedom.**

### Q: Who are the key stakeholders?
**A:** Kevin (founder) is primary stakeholder. Feedback will come from beta customers during development.

### Q: What's the tech stack for development?
**A:** React/Next.js frontend, Supabase backend. **You don't need to know this** - just design in Figma.

### Q: Will designs be user-tested?
**A:** Yes, during development phase. Initial designs will be reviewed by 2-3 contractor contacts for early feedback.

### Q: What if PakeAja pivots or changes direction?
**A:** Unlikely (problem is validated, market research done). But if scope changes, we'll discuss compensation adjustments.
