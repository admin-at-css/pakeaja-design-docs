# How to Propose - Budget & Timeline Calculation Guide

This guide helps you calculate an accurate budget and timeline proposal for the PakeAja design project.

---

## Step 1: Review All Documentation (2-3 hours)

**DO NOT skip this step.** Accurate estimates require understanding full scope.

### Required Reading (in order):
1. ✅ **[README.md](README.md)** - Project overview & application workflow
2. ✅ **[PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md)** - Business context & problem statement
3. ✅ **[PRD.md](PRD.md)** - Complete product requirements (14 sections)
4. ✅ **[USER_PERSONAS.md](USER_PERSONAS.md)** - 6 detailed personas (understand your users)
5. ✅ **[INFORMATION_ARCHITECTURE.md](INFORMATION_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Navigation structure, URL patterns
6. ✅ **[USER_FLOWS.md](USER_FLOWS.md)** - 16 detailed user flows (workflow complexity)
7. ✅ **[DESIGN_BRIEF.md](DESIGN_BRIEF.md)** - Design guidelines, creative freedom, references
8. ✅ **[SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md)** - Deliverables breakdown (23 screens, 4 phases)
9. ✅ **[DESIGN_COMPLEXITY.md](DESIGN_COMPLEXITY.md)** - Why this is complex (not a landing page)

### Optional (But Helpful):
- 📘 **[DATABASE_SCHEMA.md](DATABASE_SCHEMA.md)** - Technical reference (understand data structure)
- 📘 **[FUTURE_PHASES.md](FUTURE_PHASES.md)** - Long-term collaboration opportunities

**Estimated Review Time:** 2-3 hours for thorough understanding

---

## Step 2: Choose Your Project Scope

We offer **three options**:

### Option A: Contractor Dashboard Only (Project 1)
- **Screens:** 15 screens (contractor-facing interface)
- **Deliverables:** All 4 (wireframes, mockups, design system, prototypes)
- **Timeline:** 4-5 weeks
- **Indicative Budget:** Rp 6,000,000

**Best for:** Designers who prefer to start smaller, validate fit before Phase 2

---

### Option B: Client Portal Only (Project 2)
- **Screens:** 8 screens (client-facing interface)
- **Deliverables:** All 4 (wireframes, mockups, design system, prototypes)
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
- **Indicative Budget:** Rp 3,000,000

**Note:** This assumes design system from Project 1 exists. If you're doing ONLY Project 2 (no Project 1), timeline increases to 3-4 weeks.

**Best for:** Designers who want shorter engagement or are joining after Project 1 is complete

---

### Option C: Full Platform (Both Projects)
- **Screens:** 23 screens (15 contractor + 8 client)
- **Deliverables:** All 4 for complete platform
- **Timeline:** 6-8 weeks (full-time focus)
- **Indicative Budget:** Rp 9,000,000

**Best for:** Designers who want complete project ownership and long-term collaboration potential

---

## Step 3: Break Down Effort by Deliverable

Use this framework to calculate your hours:

### Deliverable 1: Low-Fidelity Wireframes

**Tasks:**
- Information architecture review & screen prioritization
- Sketch rough layouts for all screens
- Define basic component hierarchy (headers, sidebars, content areas)
- Create wireframe frames in Figma
- Mobile-responsive wireframe layouts

**Effort Calculation:**

| Screen Count | Hours per Screen | Total Hours |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| 15 screens (Project 1) | 0.75 - 1 hour | 11-15 hours |
| 8 screens (Project 2) | 0.75 - 1 hour | 6-8 hours |
| 23 screens (Full) | 0.75 - 1 hour | 17-23 hours |

**Time-Saving Factor:** Reusable layouts (project list → invoice list → material list can share structure)

---

### Deliverable 2: High-Fidelity Mockups

**Tasks:**
- Color palette definition (primary, secondary, neutrals, semantic colors)
- Typography system (font choices, scale, weights)
- Icon selection/creation
- Design all screens with full visual detail
- Responsive desktop + mobile layouts
- Component states (hover, active, disabled, loading, error)
- Real content examples (not lorem ipsum)

**Effort Calculation:**

| Screen Count | Hours per Screen | Total Hours |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| 15 screens (Project 1) | 3-4 hours | 45-60 hours |
| 8 screens (Project 2) | 2.5-3 hours* | 20-24 hours |
| 23 screens (Full) | 3-3.5 hours avg | 65-80 hours |

*Project 2 is faster because design system from Project 1 is reused.

**Complexity Multipliers:**
- **Data tables/dashboards:** +1 hour per complex screen (e.g., Budget Tracking, Material Management)
- **Multi-step forms:** +0.5 hour (e.g., Create Project, Invoice Generation)
- **Photo galleries:** +0.5 hour (before/after views, date filtering)

---

### Deliverable 3: Complete Design System

**Tasks:**
- Component library creation (buttons, inputs, cards, tables, modals, navigation, etc.)
- Design token documentation (colors, typography, spacing, shadows)
- Component variants (40-50+ unique components with states)
- Auto-layout & constraints setup
- Naming conventions & organization
- Style guide documentation (usage examples, do's & don'ts)

**Effort Calculation:**

| Component Type | Count | Hours Each | Total Hours |
|----------------|-------|------------|-------------|
| Basic (buttons, badges, inputs) | 15-20 | 0.5-1 hour | 10-15 hours |
| Medium (cards, navigation, tables) | 10-15 | 1-2 hours | 15-20 hours |
| Complex (modals, forms, charts) | 5-8 | 2-3 hours | 10-15 hours |
| Documentation & organization | - | - | 5-8 hours |
| **TOTAL** | **30-40 components** | - | **40-58 hours** |

**Note:** Design system effort is similar whether you do Project 1, Project 2, or both. The system must be complete regardless.

---

### Deliverable 4: Interactive Prototypes

**Tasks:**
- Identify key user flows to prototype (minimum 8)
- Link screens with interactions (click, hover, transitions)
- Add micro-interactions (button states, form validation feedback)
- Mobile prototype flows
- Test prototype in presentation mode

**Effort Calculation:**

| Flow Count | Hours per Flow | Total Hours |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| 8-10 key flows | 1.5-2 hours | 12-20 hours |

**Example Flows:**
- Contractor: Login → Create Project → Upload Photos (3-4 screens)
- Client: View Progress → Browse Gallery (2-3 screens)
- Contractor: Generate Invoice → Send to Client (3-4 screens)

---

### Deliverable 5: Revisions & Refinements

**Tasks:**
- Client feedback iterations (expect 2-3 rounds)
- Stakeholder review adjustments
- Edge case coverage (error states, empty states, loading states)
- Final polish & consistency check

**Effort Calculation:**
- **Buffer:** 20-30% of total design hours
- **Example:** If design work = 100 hours → buffer = 20-30 hours

**Why needed:**
- No design is perfect on first iteration
- Client feedback is inevitable (and valuable)
- Edge cases emerge during development handoff

---

## Step 4: Calculate Total Hours

### Example 1: Project 1 Only (15 screens)

| Deliverable | Hours |
|-------------|-------|
| Wireframes (15 screens) | 11-15 hours |
| High-fidelity mockups (15 screens) | 45-60 hours |
| Design system (full) | 40-58 hours |
| Interactive prototypes (8 flows) | 12-20 hours |
| Revisions & refinements (25% buffer) | 27-38 hours |
| **TOTAL** | **135-191 hours** |

---

### Example 2: Full Project (23 screens)

| Deliverable | Hours |
|-------------|-------|
| Wireframes (23 screens) | 17-23 hours |
| High-fidelity mockups (23 screens) | 65-80 hours |
| Design system (full) | 40-58 hours |
| Interactive prototypes (10 flows) | 15-20 hours |
| Revisions & refinements (25% buffer) | 34-45 hours |
| **TOTAL** | **171-226 hours** |

---

## Step 5: Apply Your Hourly Rate

### Indonesian Market Rates (2025):

| Experience Level | Typical Hourly Rate | Notes |
|------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Junior (1-2 years) | Rp 30,000 - 50,000/hour | Limited B2B SaaS experience |
| Mid-level (3-5 years) | Rp 50,000 - 80,000/hour | Some design system work |
| Senior (5-8 years) | Rp 80,000 - 120,000/hour | Expert in B2B SaaS, design systems |
| Expert (8+ years) | Rp 120,000 - 200,000/hour | Portfolio of complex products |

**Your rate should reflect:**
- Years of UI/UX experience
- B2B SaaS project portfolio
- Design system expertise
- Indonesian market knowledge

---

## Step 6: Calculate Your Budget Proposal

### Example Calculation (Mid-Level Designer, Full Project):

**Hours Estimate:** 180 hours (middle of 171-226 range)
**Hourly Rate:** Rp 60,000/hour
**Base Budget:** 180 × Rp 60,000 = **Rp 10,800,000**

**Compare to indicative budget:**
- Our indicative: Rp 9,000,000
- Your estimate: Rp 10,800,000
- **Difference:** +Rp 1,800,000 (20% higher)

**Options:**
1. **Negotiate:** Propose Rp 10,800,000 with justification
2. **Optimize scope:** Reduce prototype flows from 10 to 8 (save 4 hours)
3. **Accept budget:** Rp 9,000,000 = 150 hours → tighter timeline, less revision buffer
4. **Split project:** Do Project 1 now (Rp 6 juta), Project 2 later (Rp 3.5 juta)

---

## Step 7: Create Timeline Estimate

### Full Project Timeline (6-8 weeks):

**Week 1-2: Discovery & Wireframes**
- Week 1: Review documentation, wireframe first 10 screens
- Week 2: Complete remaining wireframes, stakeholder review

**Week 3-5: High-Fidelity Mockups**
- Week 3: Design system foundation (colors, typography, basic components)
- Week 4: Contractor dashboard mockups (15 screens)
- Week 5: Client portal mockups (8 screens)

**Week 6: Design System & Documentation**
- Week 6: Finalize component library, create style guide

**Week 7: Interactive Prototypes**
- Week 7: Build prototypes for 8-10 key user flows

**Week 8: Revisions & Handoff**
- Week 8: Client feedback iteration, developer handoff preparation

**Availability Impact:**
- **Full-time (40 hours/week):** 6-7 weeks
- **Part-time (20 hours/week):** 10-12 weeks
- **Freelance (15 hours/week):** 12-15 weeks

## Step 8: Fill Out Google Form

Include in your application:

### Portfolio Section:
- Link to Behance, Dribbble, or personal website
- Highlight **1-2 B2B SaaS or dashboard projects** (if available)
- Mention if you've created design systems from scratch

### Budget Proposal:
**Template:**

```
After reviewing all documentation (PRD, user flows, scope), I estimate:

Project Choice: [Option A / B / C]
Timeline: [X weeks, Y hours/week availability]
Budget Proposal: Rp [X,XXX,XXX]

Breakdown:
- Wireframes: X hours
- High-fidelity mockups: X hours
- Design system: X hours
- Prototypes: X hours
- Revisions buffer: X hours
Total: X hours × Rp X,XXX/hour = Rp X,XXX,XXX

Notes:
[If different from indicative budget, explain why.
If accepting indicative budget, confirm understanding of scope.
If proposing partial delivery, specify which screens/deliverables.]
```

### Design Approach:
- How would you approach the design system creation?
- What's your process for ensuring mobile-responsive consistency?
- How do you handle two-sided platform UX differences?

---

## Budget Alignment - What We're Looking For

### ✅ Good Budget Proposals:
- **Realistic estimate** based on documented scope
- **Clear breakdown** by deliverable (not just total number)
- **Justification** if significantly different from indicative budget
- **Transparency** about experience level and hourly rate
- **Flexibility** (open to discussion, considers partial delivery)

### ❌ Red Flag Proposals:
- **Way too low:** "Rp 2 juta for 23 screens + design system" (unrealistic, will underdeliver)
- **Way too high:** "Rp 25 juta" without justification (not aligned with market rates)
- **Vague:** "Negotiable, depends on scope" (shows didn't review documentation)
- **Per-screen pricing:** "Rp 500k per screen = Rp 11.5 juta" (doesn't account for design system)

---

## Our Indicative Budget Rationale

### Why Rp 9 juta for Full Project?

**Our Calculation:**
- **Estimated hours:** 160-180 hours (experienced designer, efficient workflow)
- **Target rate:** Rp 50,000-60,000/hour (mid-level Indonesian designer)
- **Total:** 170 hours × Rp 53,000/hour ≈ **Rp 9,000,000**

**This assumes:**
- Designer has B2B SaaS experience (no learning curve)
- Designer has created design systems before (reusable templates)
- Designer works efficiently (not first complex project)
- Minimal revision rounds (clear requirements provided)

**If you're junior or new to B2B SaaS:** You may need 200-250 hours → Higher cost OR longer timeline at same budget.

**If you're senior with strong portfolio:** You may complete in 140-160 hours → Same budget, faster delivery OR higher rate, same timeline.

## Long-Term Collaboration Impact on Pricing

**Important:** This project is **not just a one-off engagement**.

We're looking for a **design partner** for PakeAja long-term. If you deliver excellent results:

### Future Opportunities:
- **Phase 2 features:** CRM module, Inventory Management, Supplier Portal (Rp 10-15 juta)
- **Marketing materials:** Landing page redesign, pitch decks, social media (Rp 5-8 juta)
- **Icon sets & illustrations:** Custom icons, onboarding illustrations (Rp 3-5 juta)
- **Monthly retainer:** Ongoing design support (Rp 3-5 juta/month)

**Total Potential Value:** Rp 50-100 juta+ over 12-24 months

### Pricing Strategy:
Some designers choose to **price Phase 1 competitively** to win long-term partnership:
- Accept Rp 9 juta for full project (even if estimate is Rp 11-12 juta)
- Deliver exceptional quality
- Become our go-to designer for all future needs

**Think of Phase 1 as an audition** for a long-term, stable income stream.

## Common Questions

### Q: What if my estimate is Rp 15 juta but your budget is Rp 9 juta?

**Option 1:** Propose partial delivery
- "I can deliver Project 1 (15 screens) for Rp 6 juta, then Project 2 separately."

**Option 2:** Justify higher budget
- "Based on my rate (Rp 80k/hour as senior designer) and 180 hours, I propose Rp 14.4 juta. This includes [specific value-adds]."

**Option 3:** Accept budget with conditions
- "I can work within Rp 9 juta budget with 8-week timeline (part-time, 20 hours/week)."

**We're open to discussion** - honesty is valued over underbidding.

---

### Q: Can I use existing UI kits (Material Design, Ant Design, Tailwind UI)?

**Partially, but not fully.**

- ✅ **Use as inspiration** for component patterns
- ✅ **Adapt components** to match PakeAja brand
- ❌ **Don't just reskin** existing UI kit (we need custom design system)

**We want a custom design system**, not a generic template. But you can reference best practices from established systems.

---

### Q: How much creative freedom do I have?

**A lot!** See [DESIGN_BRIEF.md](DESIGN_BRIEF.md) for details.

**You decide:**
- Color palette (no brand guidelines exist yet)
- Typography (choose fonts that fit professional B2B aesthetic)
- Component style (rounded vs sharp corners, shadows vs flat, etc.)
- Layout patterns (as long as functional requirements are met)

**We provide:**
- Functional requirements (what features each screen needs)
- User flows (how screens connect)
- Design references (aesthetic direction we like)

**Rule:** As long as it's professional, efficient, and meets functional requirements → you have creative freedom.

---

### Q: What if I've never designed a B2B SaaS product before?

**Be honest in your application.**

If this is your first B2B SaaS project:
- Acknowledge learning curve in your proposal
- Add 20-30% buffer to your timeline estimate
- Propose starting with Project 1 only (lower risk for both sides)
- Highlight transferable skills (e.g., complex e-commerce dashboards, admin panels)

**We value honesty > overpromising.**

---

### Q: Do you have a preference between Option A (Project 1) vs Option C (Full Project)?

**Preference: Option C (Full Project)**

**Why:**
- Ensures design consistency across both user types
- Faster overall delivery (design system is created once)
- Allows designer to own complete product vision

**But Option A is acceptable** if:
- You want to validate fit before committing to full project
- You have limited availability (can only do 4-5 weeks now)
- You prefer smaller engagements

**Option B alone** is least preferred (requires existing design system from Project 1).

---
